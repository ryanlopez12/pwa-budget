## Project Challenges

- When deployed to Heroku app would not function properly
- When deployed locally app works just fine, I have been having issues with MongoDB where my localhost:3001 has to be changed to 127.0.0.1:3001 and the locally it works fine.
- Overall function of app isn't where I would like it to be.
